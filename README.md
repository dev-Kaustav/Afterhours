### Description

Afterhours is a dark Visual Studio Theme inspired by the great [Horizon](https://https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jolaleye.horizon-theme-vscode#:~:text=Search%20for%20Horizon%20Theme,Enjoy!) theme but adding some personal taste customizations.

The most important differences regarding Horizon theme are:

-   Editor (active tab) "virtually" floating over the window
-   Most divisions removed
-   Darker terminal, sidebar and titlebar
-   Some other minor customizations
